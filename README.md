# ann-list â€” An simple angularJS to interact with Anime News Network API

This project is a side project used to learn AngularJS and the tooling associated.
What it do is interacting with Anime News Network API (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/api.php) to retrieve a list of anime and the anime details.
At a later date, we'd like to implement a function where user will be able to save their favorites animes in a list.
